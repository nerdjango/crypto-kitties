##Usage
1. Requires an Etherem wallet like MetaMask

2. You'll need some test ETH on the Rinkeby network. Visit a faucet to get some free test ETH. Make sure you've set your wallet network to Rinkeby.

3. Visit the website link above.

4. Make sure your wallet is on the Rinkeby test network. Press the "Connect" button. This will connect the wallet to the app so it can query the blockchain for your kitties.

5. Head over to the Marketplace to get some kitties! Once you have 2 kitties you can breed them and have kittens.
